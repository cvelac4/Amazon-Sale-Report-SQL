# Amazon-Sale-Report-SQL
In this project I analyzed a Amazon sales report file (Amazon_Sales.csv). The data has been cleaned of any incorrect or inconsistent values. Missing values have also been found in the data and have been replaced with values. I was also able to manipulate the SQL code to find specific values for specific scenarios.
